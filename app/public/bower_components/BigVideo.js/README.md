# BigVideo.js
## The jQuery Plugin for Big Background Video (and Images)

Find out everything you need to know about how to use this plugin on its demo page at <http://dfcb.github.com/BigVideo.js>.

## Installation
If you're using [Bower](http://bower.io) (and you should be!) installing BigVideo and its dependencies is simply:

```
bower install BigVideo.js
```

This downloads and installs BigVideo to the ``bower_components`` folder. Add to your page the usual way with script tags, or using [RequireJS](#requirejs).

If you'd rather download things manually, you can grab the latest zip from that lovely button on the right ([or this link](https://github.com/dfcb/BigVideo.js/archive/master.zip)). You will also need the dependencies:

* [jQuery 1.7.2 or higher](http://jquery.com/download)
* [jQuery UI slider 1.8.22 or higher](http://jqueryui.com/download/#!components=1110000000000000100000000000000000)
* [Video.js 3.2 or higher](http://www.videojs.com/)
* [imagesloaded 2.1.1 or higher](http://desandro.github.io/imagesloaded/)

## RequireJS
If [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) is detected, BigVideo.js defines itself as an anonymous module. Require it as:

```javascript
require(['path/to/bigvideo'], function(bigvideo) {
	// do stuff here
});
```

Make sure your [require config](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config) is set up correctly; an example configuration is as follows:

```javascript
require.config({
	paths: {
		"BigVideo": "bower_components/BigVideo.js/lib/bigvideo",
		"jquery": "bower_components/jquery/jquery",
		"jquery-ui": "bower_components/jquery-ui/ui/jquery-ui",
		"videojs": "bower_components/video.js/video",
		"imagesloaded": "bower_components/imagesloaded/imagesloaded",
		"eventEmitter/EventEmitter": "bower_components/eventEmitter/EventEmitter",
		"eventie/eventie": "bower_components/eventie/eventie"
	},
	shim: {
		"videojs": {exports: 'videojs'}
	}
});
```

This is to ensure that BigVideo and all its dependencies get the right paths, and that RequireJS knows how to reference Video.js.
